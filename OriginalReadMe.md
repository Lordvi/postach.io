If you're a coder/webdesigner and would like to be part of an ever-expanding
community of enthusiastic bloggers and [Evernote](http://evernote.com) users, Postach.io is for you!

This boilerplate comes preloaded with [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and
[OpenGraph](http://ogp.me) meta tags support, and is optimized with
[structured data](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2650907?hl=en) using
[schema.org](http://schema.org/).

At Postach.io, we do not impose a specific development philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code any way that you want, however we recommend checking out our standardization points below in order to keep things clean and tidy.

We're open to suggestions and pull-requests, so feel free to fork &amp; modify it as you see fit.


## Quick start

Choose one of the following options:

- Download the latest stable release from [https://github.com/postachio/postachio-theme-boilerplate](https://github.com/postachio/theme-boilerplate/archive/master.zip)
- Clone this git repo: `git clone https://github.com/postachio/theme-boilerplate.git`


## Features

* HTML5 ready and built to be [responsive](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)
* Templates use [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/) so if you already know the syntax, jump in and get your hands dirty (hint: it's just HTML with some extra things in it)
* Includes [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) for CSS normalizations and common bug fixes
* Placeholder CSS media queries
* Useful LESS CSS mixins provided
* An optimized Google Analytics snippet
* Extensive inline and accompanying documentation


## Theme Documentation

For more information about theme development and how you can get started, take a look at our [theme documentation](http://docs.postach.io).


## Standardization Tips

- Use HTML5
- Use standards-compliant CSS and JavaScript
- Document your LESS/CSS and Javascript
    - This isn't just for yourself, but for others who want to contribute to furthering the development of a theme
- Retain consistency with our filenaming and folder conventions - This allows for easier integration into your theme editor and potentially our Theme Browser :)
- Provide a copy of your non-minified source code along with the minified version
    - This makes it easy to hack and recompile at a later time
- For themes we'd like to keep a standard set of CSS classes used - refer to the accompanied LESS/CSS file to see how
this is done


### What's all this talk about minifying and compiling my code?!

We use [LESS CSS](http://lesscss.org/) for CSS extensibility and rapid development. With LESS you can create reusable mixins which speed up the development process. This potentially cuts out a tonne of wasted cross-browser compatibility testing time and if you are unfamiliar with LESS, we strongly urge you to read up on it soon! 

If you're familiar with CSS, then learning LESS will be a breeze!
